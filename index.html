            <h1>My Valentine,</h1>
            <p>Happy Advanced Valentine’s Day!! hahahahah I thought sending this now would be perfect since you’re probably on the train, reading this letter while enjoying the snowy view—so romantic ✨✨ right XDD. I really wish I could be there with you right now to celebrate this lovey-dovey, romantic day together! Being with you has made me realize just how special you are to me and words can’t express how grateful I am for you. </p>
            <p>You are always so thoughtful, sweet, and warm—you have this incredible way of making me feel heard and supported in so many ways. From checking in on me, being my listener and #1 supporter, planning fun things for our calls, calling me at random times, being my alarm clock, my personal Mr. Google—you always find little ways to show you care. With you, I’ve come to realize that love isn’t about talking all day, but about the depth of our connection in even the smallest moments. You’ve made me see that sometimes, even just five minutes of pure attention and sincere words from you are enough to carry me through the day. </p>
            <p>Thank you for letting me be myself and for making me feel so appreciated in all the little ways that truly matter, it means so much to me! I hope I make you feel the same way too! Hehe :D Here’s to creating more beautiful memories together—even if most of them are through FaceTime for now, hahaha. </p>
            <p>Every piece of me loves every piece of you <3 thank you for being the incredible person that you are and I miss youuuuu! </p>
            <p>Love, <br> Qi</p>
