            <h1>Dear Bubu,</h1>
            <p>Happy Valentine's Day!! I really wish I could be there with you right now to celebrate this lovey-dovey, romantic day together! Being apart on a day like this makes me realize even more just how special you are to me. I hope you know how much you mean to me, and words can’t describe how thankful I am to have you in my life.</p>
            <p>You’re always so thoughtful, sweet, and warm—you know how to make me feel heard and supported in so many ways. From checking in on me, being my listener and #1 supporter, planning things to do during calls, texting me here and there, being my alarm clock, my Mr. Google, and even my go-to for random late-night chats—you’ve got this special way of showing you care. Thank you for letting me be myself and for all the little ways you make me feel appreciated. It really means a lot. <3 I hope I made you feel the same way too hehe :D Here’s to creating more memories together—even if most of them are through FaceTime for now, haha!</p>
            <p>Every piece of me loves every piece of you <3 thank you for being the incredible person that you are and I miss youuuuu</p>
            <p>Love, <br> Qi</p>
